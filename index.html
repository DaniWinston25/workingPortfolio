                    <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
                    <p>The passion I have for tech started young, faded a bit
                        then returned.
                        The more I learned the more I wanted to do.
                    </p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <h2>Be Inspired.</h2>
                        <p>Inspiration comes from all over, the same can be said
                            about any company
                            and their purpose.
                            Whether its a small business, family run business or
                            a big expanding
                            business, knowing the
                            client and what their company means to them helps
                            inspise the work I put
                            into their

                            <h2>Working Hard</h2>
                            <p>Web Development is a lot about working hard and
                                learning code,
                                but its also about having fun while doing it and
                                finding the balance.
                                Thats what I believe in and what I try to have
